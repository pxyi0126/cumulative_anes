       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       Approximately 15 percent of interviews (completed or partially
       completed) were randomly selected and verified by field supervisors
       for new interviewers, and 6 percent were randomly selected and verified 
       for SRC-experienced interviewers.

       Verification was attempted by phone (phone interviews) or by letter 
       (FTF interviews) within 3 days of interview date.  If no contact/
       response with the respondent was made after 3 attempts, a replacement
       line was selected.  The respondent was asked whether they were
       interviewed by the interviewer of record, the approximate length of the
       interview and whether or not the interview was interesting; in 
       addition , 3 questions were asked about content of the interview. 
       NOTE: for verification codes, a "don't remember" response is considered
       a non-match.

       0. Counted for Ann Arbor office, not selected for verification
       1. Flagged for verification (interview number selected)
       2. Verified OK (all verification data match original data exactly)
       3. Verified with discrepancy (only one piece of verification data
          does not match; everything else matches exactly)
       4. Not verified (more than 1 piece of information reported by the
          respondent at the time of verification is different from that
          collected at the time of the original interview or finalizing
          the case; further probing results in assignment of either code 3
          or code 4 as a final code)
       5. Unable to verify (R is contacted but is unwilling to participate
          in verification exercise or the respondent cannot be reached;
          this includes: reaching the household by telephone but not reaching
          the respondent, and includes sending the verification latter to a
          household but no letter returned after 3 attempts)

       This refers to interviews initially refused by someone
       when an interviewer was first attempting contact.
       The source of this refusal may or may not have been the
       Respondent; result code 43 [contact, resistance by R] or
       46 [resistance not by R] for any call (not the final
       result code) turns this indicator on.
       Conversion may be made by the initial interviewer or
       another interviewer.  If the conversion is not made by the
       initial interviewer, the interviewer of record is the
       interviewer obtaining the conversion.

       HOUSEHOLD LISTING:
       Selection table
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Selection Table is used to select a respondent from
       all household members who are eligible adults.(An
       eligible adult is a U.S. citizen who is 18 years of age or
       older by Election Day.)  The Selection Table appears on
       the Coversheet below the Household Listing.

       After a complete listing of the HH is taken, each eligible
       adult is assigned a "Number" based on the criteria of
       gender and age [beginning with the oldest male as number
       1, males are numbered by increments of 1 according to
       descending age; females are numbered by descending age
       starting with the number one higher than that assigned
       to the youngest male].  The interviewer then uses the
       Selection Table to determine the "Number" of the eligible
       adult to be interviewed.

       The Selection Table itself consists of 2 parallel
       columns.  In the first column the interviewer circles the
       total number of eligible adults in the household; in the
       second column (same row) is identified the Number" of the
       person who will be the respondent.

       There are 8 different Selection Tables used and they are
       randomly assigned. A summary describing all 8 Selection Tables
       appears below.

       Household composition
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       The HH composition code is derived from information provided in
       the household listing.  "Adults" are 18 years of age (by
       election day) or older; all individuals included in the HH
       composition codes below refer to adults.

       A designation of a HH member as "the householder" (HHR)
       describes HU member who owns or rents the home (in whose
       name the lease is held).  Cohabiting couples are coded as
       married (30,40, 50-52).  Roommates of opposite sex are
       coded 11,12,21,22; in all cases of unrelated roommates the
       respondent is HHR.

       If R identifies self as married/partnered but spouse/partner
       is residing elsewhere (nursing home, job requirement or other
       reason), R is coded as adult male HHR/adult female HHR (codes
       10-22 and 60-95) and is identified as married/partnered in
       marital status question.
       In cases 8,49,77,157,377,535,580,814,1087,1117,1202,1212,1381,
       1639,1731 the partner/spouse identified in V000909 (marital
       status) was not a resident of the HU or was residing elsewhere
       on temporary basis. In cases 1281,1516,46,312,133,23,222 there
       is no information about spouse/partner in HH listing or
       elsewhere other than marital status question.
       Note: cases with missing coversheets may be coded in this
       variable from information in call records/thumbnails.

       See the appendix on CENSUS DEFINITIONS.
       Coded according to the 1990 Census.  The major objective
       of the Census Bureau in delineating urbanized areas is to
       provide a better separation of urban and rural population
       in the vicinity of large cities.  An urbanized area
       consists of a central city or cities, and surrounding
       closely settled territory ("urban fringe").  Size of Place
       codes 21 and 41 include areas that are in the "urban
       fringe" but are not Census Places.
       Note for Codes 50-53:  in a few cases, Non-MSA PSUs (based
       on the 1980 OMB SMSA definitions) contain areas which are
       now part of a 1990 PMSA or MSA (based on the June 1990 OMB
       definition).  In these cases, the Size of Place Code for
       any SSUs (segments) within such areas are coded in the
       "40s" rather than in the "50s" as shown.  This occurred in
       El Dorado county CA (the major part of the El
       Dorado/Alpine Co, CA PSU #82) which is now a part of the
       Sacramento CA MSA, and also for one SSU (segment) in the
       Gardner MA PSU (#64), which is now a part of the
       Worchester MA MSA.

       On 11/16/00 it was discovered that the survey instrument
       program had an error in setting randomization.  Interviews
       --or, for some interviews administered over several days,
       portions of interviews --that were conducted prior to the
       correction of this error (in the 2nd VQ released on 11/16/00)
       were not administered with correctly functioning randomization.
       All cases administered prior to the correction of this error
       were administered as if only one choice in the randomization
       were available (in almost all cases, an identical choice).
       The randomization variables documented in V001752-V001810

       your feelings toward some of our political leaders and
       other people who are in the news these days. I'll read
       the name of a person and I'd like you to rate that
       person using something we call the feeling thermometer.
       Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean
       that you feel favorable and warm toward the person.
       Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you
       don't feel favorable toward the person and that you
       don't care too much for that person. You would
       rate the person at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel
       particularly warm or cold toward the person. If we
       come to a person whose name you don't recognize, you
       don't need to rate that person. Just tell me and
       we'll move on to the next one.

       Built from:
       - branching data in G6.E, G6a.E, G6b.E, G6c.E.
       - 7-pt scale data in G1ax, G1b.
       NOTE: To make 7pt scale data comparable with the construction
       of a 7-pt summary of branching data, both the 7pt-scale data in
       G1ax and the "had to choose" data in G1b were used for
       constructing this summary.  For both 7pt-scale and branching cases,
       Rs who answered moderate (4 in 7pt-scale) or DK or 'haven't thought
       much' (branching: or 'neither') were asked for the "had to choose"
       selection of liberal or conservative. Branching: If R selected
       liberal or conservative but strength followup was missing data
       (typically: DK) then 'not strong' has been coded in G6x1.

       Note:  when using combined-mode summaries (combining face-to-
       face 7-point scales with telephone branching summaries), users
       must be fully aware of the differences in the questions, 
       administration, and summary construction by mode; it is up to 
       the individual user to evaluate the importance of those 
       differences for his individual purposes.

       There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and
       hospital costs. Some people feel there should be a
       government insurance plan which would cover all medical
       and hospital expenses for everyone. Suppose these people
       are at one end of a scale, at point 1.  Others feel
       that all medical expenses should be paid by individuals
       through private insurance plans like Blue Cross or
       other company paid plans. Suppose these people are at
       the other end, at point 7. And, of course, some other
       people have opinions somewhere in between, at points
       2,3,4,5, or 6.

       Some people feel that the government in Washington
       should make every effort to improve the social and
       economic position of blacks. (Suppose these people are
       at one end of a scale, at point 1.)  Others feel that
       the government should not make any special effort to
       help blacks because they should help themselves.
       (Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.)
       And, of course, some other people have opinions
       somewhere in between, at points 2,3,4,5, or 6.

       social and economic position of blacks, or that
       government should not make any special effort to help
       blacks because they should help themselves?)
       (Do you think they feel the government should) help
       blacks to a great extent or only to some extent?

       Recently there has been a lot of talk about women's
       rights. Some people feel that women should have an equal
       role with men in running business, industry, and
       government.
       (Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at
       point 1.) Others feel that a woman's place is in the
       home. (Suppose these people are at the other end, at
       point 7.) And, of course, some other people have
       opinions somewhere in between, at points 2,3,4,5 or 6.

   Q1.

       As you know, Bill Clinton was first elected President in
       November 1992.  He will soon be leaving office after
       8 years as President.  The next several questions ask
       whether you think things have changed since Clinton
       came into office.
       First, would you say that compared to 1992, the federal
       budget deficit is now smaller, larger, or about the same?

   Y6.

       Occupation/employment variables represent 5 series of
       questions.  The question series initially assigned to R
       in Y6(1) is determined by R's self-identification of
       employment status.  The series occupation data are:
       "UNEMPLOYED"             - past occupation
       "RETIRED"                - past occupation
       "DISABLED"               - past occupation
       "HOMEMAKER" (nonworking) - past occupation
       "STUDENT"   (nonworking) - past occupation
       "WORKING NOW"            - current occupation
       "TEMPORARILY LAID OFF"   - current occupation

       Note: The final employment status summaries Y6(2)-Y6(3)
       are built using both R's initial self-identification per
       Y6(1) and additional information provided by R during
       questioning.

       The retired who are also currently working have data in
       both the RETIRED and WORKING NOW series; the disabled
       may have data in both DISABLED and WORKING NOW
       series.  For homemaker and student Rs, the 1st question
       in the HOMEMAKER/STUDENT series asks whether R is
       currently working; if so, R is immediately transferred
       out of that series to the WORKING NOW series (the
       HOMEMAKER/STUDENT series not completed).

       Since many questions are asked across multiple series,
       data for common questions across series are "stacked"
       into variables V000979-V000989; for these stacked
       variables the following data are included:

       PAST employment of all retirees [15,50,51 in Y6(1)]
       PAST employment of the unemployed [40 in Y6(1)]
       PAST employment of nonworking disabled [60 in Y6(1)]
       PRESENT employment of working disabled [16,61 in Y6(1)]
       PRESENT employment of Rs working now only [10,20 in
               Y6(1)] or working homemaker/student [17,18,71,81
               in Y6(2)]
       NO data for nonworking homemakers/students [70,75,80 in
               Y6(1)]

       ASSIGNED EMPLOYMENT SERIES
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       See notes Y6.
       This variable describes the series of employment questions
       to which R is initially assigned according to R's self-
       identification of employment status.
       By contrast, the Y6(2) and Y6(3) employment status summary
       variables are built using relevant information from R's
       Y6(1) self-identification and also from information
       obtained during questioning (especially number of hours
       worked).
       Initial series assignment from multiple mentions given
       by R for his or her own employment status is as follows:
         RET ONLY   or (RET and any others)      -->retired series
         HM/ST ONLY or (HM/ST and UN/DIS/WN/TLO) -->hmkr/st series
         DIS ONLY   or (DIS and UN/WN/TLO)       -->disabled series
         WN/TLO ONLY                             -->wrkg now series
       Note that Rs initially assigned per Y6(1) to the RETIRED,
       DISABLED or HOMEMAKER/STUDENT series are redirected from
       within those series to the WORKING NOW series if the R was
       also currently working (both series completed if retired
       or disabled). For this reason, the WORKING NOW series
       appears last in codebook variables:
       - V000921-000931 UNEMPLOYED [UN]
       - V000932-000944 RETIRED [RET]
       - V000945-000956 PERMANENTLY DISABLED [DIS]

       In 67 cases, households corresponding to more than 1 adult were
       incorrectly coded 1 in this variable; as a result of the effect
       upon the skip pattern, household income was not asked.
       For these cases, the following revisions have been made to the
       original data:  V000992 recoded to 5; V000993 [HH income] and
       V000994 [HH income summary] recoded to 00 NA; V000995 [R income]

       a lot of people were not able to vote because they
       weren't registered, they were sick, or they just didn't
       have time.
       Which of the following statements best describes you:
       One, I did not vote (in the election this November);
       Two, I thought about voting this time - but didn't;
       Three, I usually vote, but didn't this time; or

       the ballot card or read to the respondent only if that
       candidate's name was on the candidate list (preloaded into the
       instrument).
       Code 7 includes cases where R volunteered that he/she
       voted "a straight ticket" but no candidate for R's party
       ran; it also includes cases where R insists that he/she
       voted for a specific party's candidate but no candidate
       from that party ran in R's district.
       MISSOURI NOTE:  In 4 cases in Missouri (IDs 581,1071,1072,1507)
       Rs voted for Mel Carnihan (deceased).  Because this name was
       not included in the preload, these responses were coded 7.
       TELEPHONE:  The order in which the names of the major party
       candidates was read was randomized [see C9(2)].
       If an independent/3rd party candidate was on the candidate list,
       his/her name was read last.

       I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our
       political leaders and other people who are in the news
       these days. I'll read the name of a person and I'd like
       you to rate that person using something we call the
       feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 degrees and 100
       degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm
       toward the person. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50
       degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward
       the person and that you don't care too much for that
       person. You would rate the person at the 50 degree
       mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward
       the person. If we come to a person whose name you
       don't recognize, you don't need to rate that person.
       Just tell me and we'll move on to the next one.

       people from 0 to 100 degrees. Ratings between 50 degrees

       Some people think that certain groups have too much
       influence in American life and politics, while other
       people feel that certain groups don't have as much
       influence as they deserve.  I am going to read you a

       group has too much influence, just about the right amount

       Please look at page 5 of the booklet.  Some people say
       that the best way to reduce crime is to address the
       social problems that cause crime, like bad schools,
       poverty and joblessness.  (Suppose these people are at
       one end of a scale, at point 1.)  Other people say the
       best way to reduce crime is to make sure that criminals
       are caught, convicted and punished.  (Suppose these
       people are at the other end, at point 7.)  And, of
       course, some other people have opinions somewhere in
       between at points 2,3,4,5 or 6.

       Recently, there has been a lot of talk about campaign
       finance reform. Some people believe that we should
       protect government from excessive influence by campaign
       contributors. Others think that protecting the freedom
       of individuals to financially support political
       candidates and parties is more important.

       Now I have some questions about different groups in our
       society. I'm going to show you a seven-point scale on
       which the characteristics of the people in a group can
       be rated.
       In the first statement a score of 1 means that you think
       almost all of the people in that group tend to be
       "hard-working." A score of 7 means that you think most
       people in the group are "lazy." A score of 4
       means that you think that most people in the group are
       not closer to one end or the other, and of course,
       you may choose any number in between.

       As you know, Bill Clinton was first elected President in
       November 1992.  He will soon be leaving office after
       8 years as President.  The next several questions ask
       whether you think things have changed since Clinton came
       into office.
       First, would you say that compared to 1992, the federal
       budget deficit is now smaller, larger, or about the same?

       Respondents were randomly assigned either to the
       retrospective assessments battery (S1-S11) or the affects

       for the retrospective battery in the Post election
       instrument they were assigned to administration in the
       Pre (Q1-Q11) and vice versa.
