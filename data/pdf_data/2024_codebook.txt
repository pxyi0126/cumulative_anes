USER GUIDE
This document is a brief guide and codebook for the American National Election
Studies (ANES) 2024 Time Series Study, to accompany the full release of its pre-
election and post-election data on August 8, 2025.
The ANES 2024 Time Series is a continuation of the series of election studies
conducted since 1948 to support analysis of public opinion and voting behavior in
U.S. presidential elections. The 2024 study features a mixed-mode design
including in-person, internet, video, phone, and paper-and-pencil interviewing.
Two separate fresh cross-sectional samples were drawn, one for use with in-
person interviewing as the primary mode and the second for web interviewing as
the primary mode. In addition, the 2024 study features a panel of respondents
previously completed the ANES in 2016 and 2020, as well as interviews with
individuals who previously participated in the 2024 General Social Survey (GSS).

Current Release
This is the full release of the 2024 Time Series Study dataset and the third release
overall. The previous two releases were preliminary and did not contain all the
variables, processing, cleaning, and documentation that are included in this
release. Users are advised to compare their preliminary release results with the
current release to determine if the changes have any impact on their analyses.
Although data from the General Social Survey (GSS) sample were collected
alongside the ANES survey, they are not included in this release and will be
released at a later date.
This full release may also include error corrections and edits to improve accuracy
and usability. If you ﬁnd errors or have comments or questions about the data,
please communicate with ANES staﬀ by writing to anes@electionstudies.org
Sample Design
The study has four independently drawn sample components:
6 USER GUIDE
1. Fresh sample for in-person interviews
2. Fresh sample for web interviews
3. Panel re-interviews
4. GSS re-interviews (not included in this release)
Another component of the study involved a brief interview with the spouses or
partners of respondents in the fresh sample groups who were in spousal or
cohabiting relationships.
Population. The two fresh samples for in-person and web interviews describe
approximately the same population. The target population for the in-person
sample was 232.5 million U.S. citizens age 18 or older living in the 48 contiguous
states of the U.S. or Washington, D.C., and the target population for the web
sample was 234.1 million U.S. citizens age 18 or older living in the 50 states or
Washington, D.C. Both populations exclude those living in institutional or group
quarters. In both modes, the sampling frame consisted of lists of residential
addresses where mail is delivered. To be eligible to participate, a respondent had
to reside at the sampled address and be a U.S. citizen aged 18 or older at the time
of recruitment.
The ANES 2016-2020-2024 panel’s target population consisted of U.S. citizens
who were 18 or older and living in the 50 states or Washington, D.C., immediately
before the 2016 presidential election.
The General Social Survey’s target population was adult residents of the U.S. See
GSS documentation for more information about GSS sampling. GSS re-interview
data are not included in this data release and will be made available as a
supplemental ﬁle.
Sample Design
Fresh in-person sample. The fresh in-person sample was a multi-stage stratiﬁed
cluster sample. This is similar in general design, but diﬀerent in details, from past
designs of ANES Time Series studies. Sixty primary sampling units (PSUs) were
selected from across the 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C. The PSUs
were metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) or non-MSA counties, or combinations
of counties, to achieve a minimum population of 50,000 adult citizens. PSUs were
explicitly stratiﬁed by quintiles of county-level Republican vote share in 2020 and
terciles of county-level turnout in 2020, and implicitly stratiﬁed by region, and then
selected at random with probability proportional to the number of occupied
housing units as indicated by the 2020 U.S. Census, except that Los Angeles
County, CA, Cook County, IL, Harris County, TX, and Maricopa County, AZ, were
selected with certainty.
Within each PSU, four smaller areas were drawn (secondary sampling units, which
were Census Block Groups or groups of contiguous CBGs to form a minimum size
of 100 occupied housing units), and households were selected at random from
within these areas from the U.S. Postal Service’s computerized delivery sequence
7
file (DSF).
These secondary sampling units were explicitly stratiﬁed by the proportion of
owner-occupied housing units (above-median or below-median within the PSU)
and implicitly by the proportion of college graduates. Finally, the in-person sample
addresses were explicitly stratiﬁed by the predicted average turnout (four
categories, including no voter ﬁle match) and implicitly stratiﬁed by the predicted
probability of voting for Trump in 2020. Probability of a Trump vote was calculated
by (1) estimating a LASSO logistic regression model using ANES 2020 data
(regressing ANES 2020 self-reported 2020 Trump vote over multiple variables from
the voter ﬁle at the respondent level, (2) using the estimated model with the
retained variables to estimate the probability of 2020 Trump vote for each voter
matched to addresses selected in the sample, and (3) computing the average of
these estimated probabilities over voters at the same address.
Fresh web sample. The fresh web sample was selected from the DSF in two
phases from among residential addresses in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. In
the ﬁrst phase, the frame was explicitly stratiﬁed by quintiles of county-level
Republican vote share in 2020, terciles of county-level turnout in 2020, and four
census regions. A total of 40,000 addresses were selected in this phase. Then, in
the second phase, 6,800 addresses were selected, explicitly stratiﬁed by the
phase 1 strata above and also by predicted address average turnout in 2020 and
2022, and implicitly stratiﬁed by the address’ average probability of a 2020 Trump
vote.
Mode sample diﬀerences. The fresh in-person sample component of the study
does not include respondents from Alaska or Hawaii, whereas the fresh web
sample component does. This is the main substantive design diﬀerence in
eligibility and coverage for the two fresh samples, and for most analytic purposes,
it is probably ignorable because the combined population of Alaska and Hawaii is
less than one percent of the study population.
Panel sample. Respondents who completed both the ANES 2016 and ANES 2020
studies were invited to participate again in the ANES 2024 study, except for a very
small number of past respondents who opted out and asked not to be contacted
again.
Respondent recruitment and retention
Pre-election study
Fresh in-person sample. An advance letter, including a study brochure and $5 in
cash, was sent to each selected address. Following this, an interviewer visited the
address to conduct a screening interview, which was used to randomly select one
person from among the adult U.S. citizens living there to be invited for the 2024
interview. Those interviewed were given $25 or $50 during the initial phase of the
ﬁeld period, with the amount increasing to $100 after an initial non-response.
8 USER GUIDE
Interviewers were authorized to oﬀer $150 if necessary.
Fresh web sample. Selected addresses were sent a series of letters to recruit one
household member to complete a screening survey. The initial invitation letter
included $10 in cash and promised $40 for completing the online survey. The
incentive was later escalated to $100 for initial non-respondents. The screening
survey was used to randomly select one person from among the adult U.S.
citizens living at the address to complete the 2024 questionnaire online.
In cases where the person who completed the screener was not selected to
complete the 2024 questionnaire, they received either $40 or $100, as did the
selected respondent after they completed the 2024 questionnaire. If the person
who completed the screener was selected for the 2024 survey, they received one
payment of $40 or $100 after completing both the screener and the 2024
questionnaire.
Panel sample. Panelists were invited by mail, email (when available), or both, and
asked to complete the 2024 questionnaire online. Invitations included a prepaid
$10 cash incentive with a promise of $40 for completing the survey, which later
escalated to $100 after an initial non-response.
Spouse and partner survey. If a respondent in either of the fresh sample groups
had a spouse or cohabiting partner, the spouse or partner was invited to complete
a brief questionnaire, either by paper or online. Spouses/partners received
immediate invitations to participate as soon as the respondent ﬁnished their
survey. The in-person spouse/partner request was also accompanied by a $5 cash
payment. If they were not immediately available, partners from both groups
received written invitations. The web sample received an email invitation, and the
in-person sample received a paper invitation left behind with the survey and $5 in
cash enclosed. Both groups received an initial oﬀer of $20 to complete the survey,
which then escalated to $40. Reminders were sent to non-responding
spouses/partners, accompanied by paper copies of the questionnaire. In-person
non-responding partners were eventually sent web links to complete the survey.
The spouse/partner survey was only administered during the pre-election study.
Post-election study
Respondents who completed a survey or a suﬃcient partial survey in the pre-
election study were approached after the election and asked to complete a post-
election survey. Potential post-election respondents were initially oﬀered the same
incentive amount they received for their pre-election survey. On January 1, 2025,
incentive oﬀers of $25 or $50 were increased to $100 for non-ﬁnalized in-person
cases. On January 13, 2025, incentive oﬀers of $40 were increased to $100 for
non-ﬁnalized web cases. On January 16, 2025, incentive oﬀers were updated to
$200 for resistant non-ﬁnalized in-person cases.

Data Collection
Field dates. The ANES 2024 Time Series study conducted a pre-election survey
between August 3, 2024, and November 5, 2024. Election Day was November 5,
2024. The study attempted to re-interview the same respondents using a post-
election survey between November 7, 2024, and February 17, 2025.
Locations. Interviews in the face-to-face mode were usually conducted in
respondents’ homes, but could also be conducted at any location convenient for
the respondent. Video interviews and web surveys could be completed anywhere
the respondent had internet access, whether on a computer or a mobile device.
Phone surveys could be completed on any device that had phone service.

Modes of pre-election interview administration. Interviews in the face-to-face
mode were conducted by trained interviewers using computer-assisted personal
10 USER GUIDE
interviewing (CAPI) software on laptop computers. During a portion of the face-to-
face interview, the respondent answered certain sensitive questions directly on the
laptop computer, without the interviewer’s participation (known as computer-
assisted self-interviewing or CASI). In the fresh web sample, panel sample, and
GSS sample, respondents were eligible to complete the survey in the web mode.
Toward the end of the ﬁeld period, non-respondents in the fresh web sample
received a highly abbreviated four-page paper-and-pencil (PAPI) questionnaire,
and were able to complete the survey in either the web or paper-and-pencil mode.
With the exception of n = 245 paper-and-pencil cases, all other respondents in the
fresh web group completed the survey in the web mode. All panel and GSS
respondents completed the survey via the web mode. All cases in the fresh in-
person sample were initially invited to a face-to-face interview; however, in some
cases, the interview was conducted partly or entirely by phone (n = 76) rather than
face-to-face (n = 966).
Modes of post-election interview administration. All fresh web, panel, and GSS
sample respondents from the pre-election survey were invited to complete the
post-election survey using the same mode in which they completed the pre-
election survey.
Most in-person sample respondents were oﬀered the opportunity to complete the
post-election survey by video. To be eligible to participate in the post-election
study using the video mode, respondents had to both 1) have access to the
internet at home, and 2) score lower than four on variable IW_RATE, indicating that
they liked the pre-election interview. In-person sample respondents who were
eligible to participate via video were asked to schedule an appointment during the
post-election data collection period.
Respondents who were either not eligible for video, did not set a video
appointment, or missed their video appointment received a face-to-face visit for
the post-election study. In some cases, respondents in the in-person sample who
could not be reached by video or face-to-face were subsequently interviewed by
phone. Respondents completing the survey by video or phone had the questions
from the CASI portion of the questionnaire read out loud to them by the
interviewer.
Interview length. The median administration times for the pre-election interviews,
not counting screening procedures, were approximately 93 minutes for the in-
person sample, 63 minutes for the fresh web sample, and 72 minutes for the panel
sample. The median administration times for the post-election interviews were
approximately 99 minutes for the in-person sample, 68 minutes for the fresh web
sample, and 71 minutes for the panel sample.
Languages. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish.
Response Rates
Pre-election interviews were considered suﬃcient to be counted as completions
11
for weighting and calculation of the response rate when the survey was
administered at least to the self-reported gender question (SELFGEND_GENDTYP)
at the beginning of the CASI section of the questionnaire (and following other
demographic items). Post-election interviews were considered suﬃcient to be
complete if the respondent completed the VOTE section of the instrument. In both
the pre- and post-election studies, respondents completing the associated
abbreviated paper-and-pencil questionnaire are also counted as suﬃcient
completions.
The following response rates are calculated using the American Association for
Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) formula for the minimum response rate, AAPOR
Response Rate 1.
The pre-election response rate was 33.4 percent for the fresh in-person sample
and 37.7 percent for the fresh web sample. The pre-election re-interview rate for
the panel sample (conditional on previously completing the ANES 2016 and 2020
studies and being invited to the 2024 study) was 82.0 percent.
The overall post-election re-interview rate was 89.9 percent of pre-election
respondents. The post-election re-interview rate for the fresh in-person sample
was 88.8 percent and 85.3 percent for the fresh web sample. The post-election re-
interview rate for the panel sample was 95.3 percent.
The pre-election response rates and post-election re-interview rates for the GSS
sample will be reported in the supplemental release of those data.
Restricted Data Access
Some variables, including date of birth, the respondent’s ZIP code, and verbatim
answers to open-ended questions, are coded “-3. Restricted access” on this
public use dataset. Data for many of these variables can be obtained through a
Restricted Data Access agreement. Please see the ANES website for more
information.
Responses to a selection of open-ended questions are made available to the
public after the responses have been redacted for conﬁdentiality.
Data Analysis, Weights, and Variance Estimation
Analyses should be weighted to represent the U.S. adult citizen population
accurately. Sampling error calculations should account for the complex sample
design and the eﬀects of weighting on variance.
The data can be analyzed using the combined fresh sample, the fresh in-person
sample alone, or the fresh web sample alone.
12 USER GUIDE
Weight variable selection
The list below indicates which weight variable to use for diﬀerent types of analyses
with the full release data. In general, if any post-election data are used for an
estimate (alone or in combination with pre-election data), a post-election weight
variable should be used, while analyses using solely pre-election data should use
a pre-election weight.

Sampling errors and signiﬁcance testing
The study is not a simple random sample, so statistical procedures for complex
13
sample designs must be used to obtain correct estimates of sampling errors and
correct indications of statistical signiﬁcance. Statistical software such as Stata, R
with a survey analysis package, or SPSS with the Complex Samples package can
perform a Taylor Series estimation of sampling errors when provided with the
appropriate strata and cluster variables. In Stata, the command to set up this type
of analysis is as follows:
svyset [pweight=WEIGHT], psu(CLUSTER) strata(STRATA)
In the code example above, WEIGHT would be replaced with the correct weight
for the type of analysis being performed (as indicated in the previous section on
weighting). STRATA and CLUSTER would be replaced with the variables for the
corresponding analysis, as shown below.
For weight use variance PSU and use variance stratum

A note on subpopulation analysis or analysis with missing data
When conducting design-consistent variance estimation, cases should be
selected by designating a subpopulation for the analysis procedure, not by
dropping cases from the analysis or excluding missing data listwise. For some
analyses the estimated standard errors from these two methods may be the same,
or nearly so, but in other circumstances, failing to designate a subpopulation
makes the standard error estimates incorrect. Also, in some cases, failing to
designate a subpopulation may prevent the calculation of standard errors
altogether by reducing the number of cases in a stratum to one. If, for example,
Stata’s output omits standard errors and includes the note, “Missing standard
errors because of stratum with single sampling unit,” this is usually because the
user has dropped cases (explicitly or through extensive listwise deletion) instead
of designating a subpopulation. Designating a subpopulation will solve the
problem. In brief, this means using code of the following general form (for
proportions from a single variable, in Stata):
svy, subpop(INCLUDE):prop VAR
In this example, INCLUDE is the name of a variable you generate to identify the
subpopulation (with included cases coded 1 and excluded case coded 0) and VAR
is the name of the variable for which proportions are generated. Similarly, you may
use:
svy, subpop(if VAR >=1 & VAR <=5): prop VAR
This example selects cases conditional on VAR having values from 1 through 5.
Other statistical software, such as R and SPSS, have comparable procedures. For
more information about this kind of procedure, see the How To Analyze ANES
Survey Data document linked above or the documentation for the statistical
software you use.
A note on weights and modes
The weights are organized by sample group, which is distinct from the mode of
interview. As detailed above in the Data Collection section, the fresh in-person
15
sample includes interviews conducted in-person, by telephone, and over live two-
way video. Weighting using the “in-person weight” selects the in-person sample,
not only face-to-face interviews. Sample and mode can be identiﬁed (variables
V240002a, V240002b and V240003), but within sample groups, the mode of
interview was not randomly assigned, so analysts should be cautious about
making mode comparisons or attributing diﬀerences among modes of interview to
the interview mode itself; apparent mode diﬀerences may also be due to selection
eﬀects.
Reporting weighted sample sizes
When reporting the sample size (n) for an analysis, the actual, unweighted sample
sizes should be reported, and analysts should take care not to confuse weighted
sample sizes with unweighted sample sizes. Some statistical software applications
make this distinction more readily than others. Generally, software designed for
design-consistent survey estimation will report actual sample sizes, but software
using non-survey procedures (such as frequency weights) will not. When
frequency weights are used, the weighted sample size usually does not reﬂect the
actual number of cases used in an analysis procedure (because weights vary,
most analyses will exclude one or more cases due to selection criteria, listwise
deletion or both, and the sums of subgroup weights are not constrained to sum to
the actual sample size). In this case, in addition to running a weighted analysis, it
is necessary to also run an unweighted analysis (taking care to select the same
cases) in order to obtain correct sample sizes.
Weighting methods
The weights were computed in multiple steps to account for sample design
features and to reduce various non-sampling error sources. The in-person and
web pre-election surveys used a similar approach, as follows. Design weights
were calculated to account for address sampling probabilities and the within-
household selection of a single eligible adult. An adjustment was also performed
to handle addresses whose eligibility was not able to be determined, redistributing
their design weights to the remaining addresses with a known eligibility from their
same corresponding stratum. To address both screening and main survey non-
response, a propensity stratiﬁcation approach was used for each component. In
this approach, the probability of each eligible address to complete the survey was
estimated using a logistic regression model of survey response over a set of
covariates observed for both respondents and non-respondents. The eligible
addresses were then divided into deciles of their estimated response propensities
and the inverse of the average of these propensities for each decile was used as a
non-response adjustment factor. Finally, a calibration adjustment was applied to
ensure that the weighted sample distribution matched the population distribution
with respect to various characteristics.
Upon some modelling of 2024 turnout and vote choice using ANES data, the
16 USER GUIDE
following dimensions were ultimately selected to be used in the calibration:
Race by sex;
Marital status by sex;
Educational attainment by age,
Educational attainment by region;
Income by race/ethnicity;
Home tenure;
Nation of birth;
Population density;
Education attainment by metropolitan status.
The following variables (and categories) were used for the calibration:
Sex (male, female)
Age (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60 years or older)
Educational attainment (less than high school graduate, high school
graduate, some college, college degree, graduate degree)
Race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-
Hispanic other)
Home tenure (home owner, other)
Nation of birth (U.S. born, foreign born)
Marital status (married, widowed, divorced or separated, never married)
Household income (less than $40,000, $40,000-$74,999, $75,000-
$124,999, $125,000 or more)
Population density (less than 471 people/square mile, 471-2,377
people/square mile, 2,377-5,505 people/square mile, more than 5,505
people/square mile)
Metropolitan status (non-metropolitan, metropolitan)
Missing values in calibration variables were imputed for the purposes of weighting.
Population benchmarks (control totals) were based on the 2023 American
Community Survey 1-year estimates, except for population density, which was
from the 2020 census, and metropolitan status, which was from the March
supplement of the 2024 Current Population Survey.
To reduce weighting variability, the ﬁnal weights were bounded at 5 times the
average of their corresponding unbounded calibrated weights.
The panel survey used a similar approach, except that it started with the 2020
ANES ﬁnal weights as an input weighting variable and only the main survey non-
response adjustment and calibration procedure were applied, as the other
adjustments were already embedded in the input weight.
Weights for various combinations of the samples (such as weights for the entire
sample, or for the in-person and web combined) received two additional
adjustments. First, the samples were integrated using a Hartley estimator
composite factor. In this process, each sample received a composite factor θ (with
17
0 < θ < 1) proportional to the mean square error of their corresponding estimate for
the proportion of Trump voters in the 2024 election. The mean square error was
estimated using an estimate of bias and sampling variance. The bias was
estimated as the diﬀerence between the sample estimate of Trump voter
proportions and the true value according to the election results. The sampling
variance estimate used respondent data accounting for all the design features,
including weights, stratiﬁcation, and clustering. Second, an additional calibration
adjustment, following the same speciﬁcations as the initial calibration, was applied
over the combined sample.
Orientation to the Data and Documentation
Dataset
The ANES 2024 Time Series Study Full Release is available in multiple ﬁle formats:
SPSS (.sav), Stata (.dta), Comma Separated Values (.csv), and a ﬁxed-width raw
data ﬁle that can be read into SAS, SPSS, and Stata using syntax statements that
have been provided.
Variables are stored using formats optimized for their data type. Missing data are
coded as negative numbers, for instance, “-8. Don’t know”.
Along with the dataset, users should also download and make use of the two
following pieces of documentation:
Questionnaire
The ﬁrst piece of documentation is the Questionnaire, a document that provides
information about each of the questions that were asked in the main survey. The
questions in the Questionnaire are presented in the order they were asked. The
Questionnaire includes the following information, where applicable, for each
question: the section in which the question appears, question name, question
wording, universe (where only a subset of respondents was to receive the
question, which respondents those should be), and response options.
In addition to the Questionnaire, ANES separately provides the PAPI (paper-and-
pencil) and SPS (Spouse and Partner Survey) survey questionnaires in PDF format.
Both documents are available for download from the 2024 Time Series study page
of the ANES website.
User Guide and Codebook
The second piece of documentation is the User Guide and Codebook. You are
currently reading the User Guide, which provides a brief overview of the study and
how to use its data and documentation.
18 USER GUIDE
The remainder of this ﬁle, after the User Guide, consists of the Codebook.
Whereas the Questionnaire provides information about the questions asked in the
survey, the Codebook provides information about the variables that appear in the
dataset.
Questions and variables do not always have a one-to-one relationship. For
instance, multiple questions may be combined into a single summary variable. Or
various variables may be derived from a single question. Furthermore, not all
variables have associated questions — for example, administrative variables.
The Codebook includes the following information, where applicable, for each
variable: the variable name (all variable names start with a “V”, and summary
variables end with the suﬃx “x”), variable label (with “PRE:” indicating that it is
from the pre-election study), simpliﬁed question wording, response/code values
and meanings, associated survey question(s), universe (where only a subset of
respondents appear in a variable, which respondents those should be; note that
universes are not included for most summary variables), information about
whether randomization was used, and interviewer instructions.

[REVISED]
Question
Four years ago, in 2020, Joe Biden ran on the Democratic ticket
against Donald Trump for the Republicans. We talk to many people
who tell us they did not vote. And we talk to a few people who tell us
they did vote, who really did not. We can tell they did not vote by
checking with oﬃcial government records.
What about you? If we check the oﬃcial government voter records,
will they show that you voted in the 2020 presidential election, or that
you did not vote in that election?

know the answer to a question. We will ask you about several public

that you will have to guess.
In fact, for some of these questions, if you answer correctly, we will
know that you probably looked up the answer.
Please do not look up the answers you do not know. Instead, please

Some people say that because of past discrimination, blacks should
be given preference in hiring and promotion. Others say that such
preference in hiring and promotion of blacks is wrong because it
gives blacks advantages they haven’t earned. What about your

blacks, and how strongly?
