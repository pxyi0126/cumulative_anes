User’s Guide and Codebook for the ANES 2016 Time Series Study 
September 4, 2019 Release 
 
This document is a brief guide and a codebook for the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016 
Time Series study, to accompany the re‐ release of the data in December 2018. 
 
The ANES 2016 Time Series is a continuation of the series of election studies conducted by the ANES 
since 1948 to support analysis of public opinion and voting behavior in U.S. presidential elections. This 
year’s study features a dual‐mode design with both traditional face‐to‐face interviewing (n=1,180) and 
surveys conducted on the Internet (n=3,090), and a total sample size of 4,270.  
 
Current Release 
 
This data release in September 2019 (version 20190904) replaces the previous, December 2018, release 
of the data. The current release mainly reflects the following additions or changes to the data file: 
 
 Additional sample variables and sample variable placeholders have been added (V163003‐
V163008) 
 
 Additional pre/post summary variables have been added (V162063x & V162064x) 
 
 Previously unreleased cases have been added to V162129 (web cases) and V162367 (face‐to‐face 
cases) 
 
 Missing data previously coded as ‐1 (Inap) in summary variables have been recoded to ‐2 
(Missing) 
 
 Minor edits to variable and value labels  
 
 Erratum from February 5, 2019 affecting variables V162032x and V161121‐V161125 have been 
resolved and updated in this release.

Sample Design and Respondent Recruitment 
 
The study has two independently drawn probability samples that describe approximately the same 
population. The target population for the face‐to‐face mode was 222.6 million U.S. citizens age 18 or 
older living in the 48 contiguous states of the USA or the District of Columbia, and the target population 
for the Internet mode was 224.1 million U.S. citizens age 18 or older living in the 50 US states or the 
District of Columbia. In both modes, the sampling frame was lists of residential addresses where mail is 
delivered, and to be eligible to participate, a respondent had to reside at the sampled address and be a 
U.S. citizen age 18 or older at the time of recruitment. 
 
Face‐to‐face face mode. The sample for in‐person interviews was a multi‐stage stratified cluster sample. 
This is similar in general design but different in details from past designs of ANES Time Series studies. 
Sixty primary sampling units (PSUs) were selected from across the 48 contiguous states and Washington 
DC. The PSUs were counties, or combinations of counties to form a minimum population of 50,000, or,   
in the case of Los Angeles County, half‐counties (i.e. L.A. County was divided into two PSUs due to its 
large size). Counties were stratified by Census region, prevalence of poverty and members of minority 
groups, and population size, and then selected at random with probability proportional to the number   
of adult citizens, except that Cook County, IL, Harris County, TX, Maricopa County, AZ, and both halves of 
Los Angeles, CA, were selected with certainty. 
 
Within each PSU, four smaller areas were drawn (secondary sampling units, which were Census Block 
Groups), and households were selected at random from within these areas from the US Postal Service’s 
computerized delivery sequence file (DSF). An advance letter was sent to each selected address that 
included a study brochure and $5 in cash, after which an interviewer visited the address to complete a 
screening interview to randomly select one person to be interviewed from among the adult U.S. citizens 
living there. Those interviewed were given $25 or $50 during the initial phase of the field period (with 
$50 offered in PSUs where predicted response propensity was low and $25 offered elsewhere), 
escalating to $100 after initial non‐response. 
 
During the last two weeks of data collection, subsampling was performed in which half of the remaining 
eligible cases from the face‐to‐face were dropped from the study to focus field efforts on the other half. 
The weights account for this subsampling by up‐weighting the cases retained at this stage. 
 
Internet mode. The sample for the Internet mode was a random draw from the DSF (excluding “drop 
point” addresses), with all included residential addresses across the 50 states and Washington DC having 
equal probability of selection. Selected addresses were sent a series of letters to recruit one household 
member to go online to complete a survey. The invitation letter included $20 in cash and promised $40 
for completing a survey online (later escalated to $80 for initial non‐respondents). This online survey 
included a screening instrument to randomly select one person from among the adult U.S. citizens living 
at the address to complete the ANES questionnaire online and receive $40 or $80. 
 
Mode sample differences. The face‐to‐face component of the study does not include respondents from 
Alaska or Hawaii; the Internet component does. This is the main substantive design difference in 
eligibility and coverage for the two modes and for most analytic purposes it is probably ignorable 
because the combined population of Alaska and Hawaii is less than 1 percent of the study population.

Data Collection 
 
Field dates. The study interviewed respondents in a pre‐election survey between September 7 and 
November 7, 2016. Election day was November 8. The study re‐interviewed as many as possible of the 
same respondents in a post‐election survey between November 9 and January 8, 2017. 
 
Locations. In‐person interviews were normally conducted in the respondent’s homes, but were allowed 
to be conducted at any location that was convenient for the respondent. Internet questionnaires could 
be completed anywhere the respondent had access to the Internet, on a computer or on a mobile 
device. 
 
Modes of administration. In‐person interviews were conducted by trained interviewers using computer‐ 
assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) software on laptop computers. During a portion of the in‐person 
interview, the respondent answered certain sensitive questions on the laptop computer directly, 
without the interviewer’s participation (known as computer assisted self‐interviewing). Respondents 
were only eligible to compete the survey in the mode for which they were sampled; no one sampled for 
the Internet study was interviewed by a live interviewer, and no one sampled for the face‐to‐face 
interview completed the study online. 
 
Interview length. The pre‐election and post‐election questionnaires were designed for a median 
administration time of approximately 80 minutes each, not counting screening procedures. 
 
Languages. Interviews in both modes were conducted in English or Spanish. 
 
Response Rates 
 
The response rate, using the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) formula for the 
minimum response rate (known as AAPOR Response Rate 1) on the pre‐election interview, was 50 
percent for the face‐to‐face component and 44 percent for the Internet component. The response rate 
for the face‐to‐face component is weighted to account for subsampling during data collection; due to 
subsampling for the face to face mode, the unweighted response rate would not be meaningful. The re‐ 
interview rate on the post‐election survey was 90 percent for the face‐to‐face component and 84 
percent for the Internet component. 
 
Pre‐election interviews were considered sufficiently complete to be counted as completions for 
weighting and for calculation of the response rate when the survey was administered through the last 
item of the demographic section “DEM3.”  There were a 4,271 pre‐election interviews. 
 
Restricted Data Access 
 
Some variables, including date of birth, the respondent’s ZIP code, and answers to open‐ended 
questions are coded “‐3. Restricted access” on the public use dataset. Data for many of these variables 
can be obtained through a Restricted Data Access agreement. See the ANES website for more 
information. Redacted texts for non‐confidential open‐ends are available for download from the ANES 
2016 Time Series study page. 
 
Data Analysis, Weights, and Variance Estimation 
 
The data can be analyzed using the combined dual‐mode sample, or using the face‐to‐face sample 
6 
alone, or using the Internet sample alone. In the combined sample, the larger number of Internet 
sample cases makes that mode dominate the estimates by a ratio of about 3:1. 
 
Analysis should be weighted to accurately represent the population. Sampling error calculations should 
account for the complex sample design and the effects of weighting on variance. 
 
Weights 
 
To analyze the complete dataset (both web and face‐to‐face modes) using variables from the post‐ 
election survey only or from both the pre‐election and post‐election questionnaires, use the weight 
V160102. For analysis of the complete dataset using only the pre‐election questionnaire data, use the 
weight V160101. 
 
The table below indicates the weight variable to use for different types of analysis.

V160102  full sample using post‐el ection survey only or both pre and post

V160101w  Internet mode alone, usin g data from only the pre‐election survey 
 
Sampling errors and significance testing 
 
The study is not a simple random sample, so statistical procedures for complex sample designs must be 
used to obtain correct estimates of sampling errors and correct indications of statistical significance. 
Statistical software such as Stata, R with a survey analysis package, or SPSS with the Complex Samples 
package can perform a Taylor Series calculation of sampling errors when provided with the appropriate 
strata and cluster variables. In Stata, the command to set up this type of analysis is as follows: 
 
svyset [pweight=WEIGHT], strata(STRATA) psu(CLUSTER) 
 
In the code example above, WEIGHT would be replaced with the correct weight for the type of analysis 
being performed (as indicated in the previous section on weighting). STRATA and CLUSTER would be 
replaced with the variables for the corresponding analysis as indicated below. 
 
Variable  Definition  
V160201  Stratum – Full sample 
V160201f  Stratum – Face‐to‐face sample 
V160201w  Stratum – Web sample 
V160202  Variance PSU – full sample 
V160202f  Variance PSU – Face‐to‐face sample 
V160202w  Variance PSU – Web sample 
 
For example, the code to set up Stata for an analysis of the full sample that includes one or more 
variables from the post‐election survey is as follows: 
 
svyset [pweight=V160102], strata(V160201) psu(V160202)

Orientation to the Data File 
 
File formats 
 
The data file is provided in three formats: Stata (.dta), SPSS (.sav), and ASCII format. The ASCII file uses a 
| (pipe or bar) delimiter. The “readme” file included with the ASCII data package describes how to use 
provided syntax files in Stata, SPSS, or SAS to build a data file. However, the complete Stata and SPSS 
datasets may also be downloaded directly from the ANES website. 
 
Variables 
 
There are 1,290 variables on the file. They are named with the numerical naming system common to 
most ANES data sets, such as V160001. An overview of the variables is as follows:

Missing data 
 
Missing data are coded to indicate the reason they are missing, using the following codes and 
categories: 
‐1. Inapplicable 
‐2. Text responses available in separate file or coded version will be included in future release 
‐3. Restricted 
‐4. Error 
‐5. Breakoff, sufficient partial IW 
‐6. No post‐election interview 
‐7. No post data, deleted due to incomplete IW 
‐8. Don’t know 
‐9. Refused 
 
Codebook 
 
The following pages contain entries for each variable on the data file. The heading on each page is the 
variable name. “Label” is the variable label; “Item name” is the name of the item on the questionnaire; 
8 
“Question” provides wording of the question asked. For continuous variables, an “Unweighted 
Summary” provides summary statistics for the face‐to‐face, web, and combined samples. For categorical 
variables, the numerical codes, value labels, and frequencies, and percentages are given. Note that the 
percentages give a percentage distribution across all values, including missing values. Weighted 
population estimates would exclude missing values from the denominator of the proportions, and as 
such the percentages given in the codebook generally do not constitute population estimates.
