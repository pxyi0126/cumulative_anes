USER GUIDE
This document is a guide and codebook for the American National Election Studies
(ANES) 2020 Time Series Study, to accompany the full release of its pre- and post-
election data.
The ANES 2020 Time Series Study is a continuation of the series of election
studies conducted since 1948 to support analysis of public opinion and voting
behavior in U.S. presidential elections. This year’s study features re-interviews with
2016 ANES respondents, a freshly drawn cross-sectional sample, and post-
election surveys with respondents from the General Social Survey (GSS). All
respondents were assigned to interview by one of three mode groups—by web,
video, or telephone. The study has a total of 8,280 pre-election interviews and
7,449 post-election re-interviews.

Current Release
This is a full release of this dataset and the third release overall. The previous two
releases were preliminary, and did not contain some of the variables, processing,
cleaning, and documentation that are a part of this current release. In particular,
this release includes the following additions or changes to the data file:
Weights: The survey weights have been updated since the last preliminary release
and are considered final weights. The new weights reduce the error in survey
estimates of the presidential election outcome and allow design-consistent
estimates of smaller subgroups.
Summary Variables: Additional summary variables have been added. Summary
variables have the suffix ‘x’ at the end of each variable name.
2 USER GUIDE
Upcodes: The open-ended options that were a part of some variables, for example
“Other: specify” categories, have been coded.
Corrections: Corrections to age, gender, other variables, or a combination of these
were made after reviewing respondent comments that reported a data entry error
or after staff review identified inconsistencies and we followed up with respondents
to confirm the correct information. Such corrections were made to 216 cases
identified in V200009.
Removed data: Post-election interview data were removed for four cases because
a review indicated that the post-election respondent was not the selected person
and was not the same person who completed the pre-election interview. The pre-
election data were not affected. The cases IDs (V200001) where all post-election
data were removed are 333168, 350453, 347372, and 414401.
As a result of these and other updates, users are recommended to check their
preliminary release results against this current release, to assess whether the
changes have any effect on their analyses.
Although GSS data were collected alongside the ANES post-election survey, they
are not part of this release and will instead be released at a later date.
We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the dataset or documentation

Sample Design and Respondent Recruitment
The 2020 ANES survey used a contactless, mixed-mode design that was created
in response to challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic made
face-to-face interviewing unfeasible in 2020, and no in-person interviewing was
done. Instead, a sequential mixed-mode design was implemented that included
self-administered online surveys, live video interviews conducted online, and
telephone interviews.
Sample Design
The 2020 ANES sample consists of several groups, summarized in Table 1 below1.

The 2016 ANES group consisted of respondents who had participated in the ANES
2016 Time Series Study. The remaining sample was based on a freshly drawn
cross-section, and addresses were randomly assigned to one of three sample
groups where the groups correspond to a survey mode sequence. The target
population for the fresh cross-section was the 231 million non-institutional U.S.
citizens aged 18 or older living in the 50 US states or the District of Columbia. The
sampling frame for the fresh cross-section was lists of residential addresses where

provided in a future data product.

mail is delivered, and to be eligible to participate, a respondent had to reside at the
sampled address and be a U.S. citizen age 18 or older at the time of recruitment.
Residential addresses in the fresh cross-sectional group received mail invitations.
The 2016 ANES respondents were invited by email where possible, with letters
used if there was no email on file or after an initial non-response. Letters and
emails pushed household members from the sampled addresses to respond to a
screener on the web. Once a screener interview was completed, responding
households followed different protocols for survey mode based on assignment to
different sample groups. All respondents who completed the post-election survey
did so in the same mode used for the pre-election survey.
The sections that follow describe the specifics of the sample groups for 2020.
Fresh Cross-Sectional Sample
The fresh cross-sectional sample was a random draw from the USPS computerized
delivery sequence file (C-DSF), with all included residential addresses across the
50 states and Washington DC having equal probability of selection.
Addresses in the fresh cross-sectional sample were randomly assigned to one of
three sequential mode conditions: web-only, mixed web, and mixed video.
Selected addresses were sent a series of letters to recruit one household member
to go online to complete a survey. The invitation letter included $10 in cash and
promised $40 for completing a survey online. Household members following the
invitation link were taken to a screening instrument to randomly select one person
from among the adult U.S. citizens living at the address to complete the ANES
questionnaire. Upon completion of the screener, the selected respondent was
invited to complete the survey based upon the mode of their assigned group. All
web-only respondents completed the survey online. Mixed web respondents were
offered web, and non-respondents and refusals received offers to complete the
survey by phone. Mixed video respondents were offered live video interviewing via
Zoom; non-respondents were offered web and later, phone. Among all groups of
the fresh cross-sectional sample, non-responding households were offered
escalated incentives of $100 later in the field period.
Web-Only (Web). Cases assigned to the web-only group were released in two
replicates for the pre-election survey. Forty percent of cases were assigned to the
first replicate, which was released at the beginning of the field period in conjunction
with the other sample groups that received the pre-election study. The remaining
60% were assigned to the second replicate which was released partway through
the field period, after the Republican and Democratic conventions. Releasing the
sample in two replicates served two purposes. The timing of the first replicate
release maximized the time available for data collection and comparability to other
sample groups in 2020 while the second replicate’s field period roughly
corresponds to the field period of previous ANES Time Series studies, which
typically began after the conventions.

Respondents in both replicates completed both the pre- and post-election surveys
online. The post-election field period was the same for both replicates.
Mixed Web (Web + Phone). Respondents in the mixed web group completed
surveys online. Non-responding cases and refusals were shifted to the telephone,
and the timing of this shift was at the case-level in the final weeks of the pre-
election period. Respondents completed the post-election survey in the same mode
as the pre-election survey. In addition to the incentives described above, some
respondents in this group were offered $200 as part of a targeted, adaptive design
approach; in the last two weeks of the pre-election field period, participants in
under-represented groups (with a low response rate) were offered $200 to
complete the questionnaire.
Mixed Video (Video + Web + Phone). Respondents in the mixed video group were
invited to complete the survey by live video interview upon completion of the web
screener. Following the invitation link, respondents were invited to wait briefly to
connect with an interviewer and complete the study via Zoom or set an
appointment. Respondents were shifted to web if they declined the video invitation
or if they failed to respond to the invitation after several attempts. Later, non-
respondents to web were subsequently pushed to phone. The timing of this shift
was at the case-level in the final weeks of the pre-election period. In addition to the
incentives described above, $200 escalations were offered for respondents to
complete interviews by video to counter initial non-response. Respondents
completed the post-election survey in the same mode as the pre-election survey.
Respondents from Previous Studies and Opportunities to Link Datasets
ANES 2016 sample. This sample consists of the full set of sample members from
the ANES 2016 Time Series Study who completed the post-election interview in
either the web or the face-to-face mode. All respondents in this sample group
completed the 2020 survey online. Invitations were made by e-mail and mail. Mail
invitations included $10 in cash and all invitations promised $40 for completing a
survey online. Non-respondents were offered escalated incentives of $100 later in
the field period, and some respondents from groups with low re-interview rates
were targeted with $200 offers in the final two weeks of the field period.
For the ANES 2016 participants in this study, data can be merged from the ANES
2016 Time Series Study using the 2016 case ID variable, V160001_orig, to join the
datasets.
GSS sample. This sample was run in the post-election study only and consisted of
respondents who have previously participated in the General Social Survey. The
current release of the dataset does not include GSS participants. Data from GSS
participants, and more information about the GSS sample’s participation in this
study and about linking the ANES and GSS datasets will be provided in a future
release of the data.
6 USER GUIDE
Data Collection
Field Dates. The study interviewed respondents in a pre-election survey that was
conducted between August 18, 2020 and November 3, 2020. Election day was
November 3, 2020. The study re-interviewed as many as possible of the same
respondents in a post-election survey that was conducted between November 8,
2020 and January 4, 2021.
An exception to the aforementioned field dates was for the web-only sample group
(see the Sample Design section for a description of this group), which was fielded
in two replicates. The first replicate for this group followed the field dates described
above. However, the first interviews for the second replicate instead began on
September 11, 2020 and ended at the same time as the other sample groups. The
post-election interviews for the second replicate took place at the same time as the
other sample groups.
Locations. For video or web modes, the survey could be completed anywhere the
respondent had access to the Internet on a computer or other device (including
mobile devices). Likewise, phone surveys could be completed on any device with
phone service.
Administration. Phone and video interviews were conducted by trained interviewers
using interviewing software on computers.
For the telephone interviews, interviewers logged into a web questionnaire based
on the one that respondents used when they completed the self-administered web
questionnaire. In the telephone interviews, interviewers read these questions aloud
to the respondents.
For the live video interviews, interviewers used a different version of the computer-
aided interviewing software. Interviewers also had a window open with a Zoom
(video communication software) connection to respondents. Interviewers could
share a window with the respondent booklet via Zoom so that respondents, for
select questions, could see pages of a Respondent Booklet that included response
categories for the question.
Unlike in earlier years, the 2020 ANES did not use self-interviewing (CASI) during
any part of the interviewer-administered modes (video and phone). Rather, in
interviewer-administered modes, all questions were read out loud to respondents,
and respondents answered orally.
Languages. Interviews in all modes were able to be conducted in English or
Spanish.
Interview Length. The median pre-election interview length was 71 minutes, which
includes a median of 69 minutes in the online mode and 93 minutes in the video
7
mode. The median post-election interview length was 78 minutes, which includes a
median of 76 minutes in the online mode and 98 minutes in the video mode.
Response Rates
The response rate, using the American Association for Public Opinion Research
(AAPOR) formula for the minimum response rate (known as AAPOR Response
Rate 1) on the pre ‐ election interview, was 36.7 percent overall for the fresh cross-
sectional component of the sample (the web-only, mixed web, and mixed video
combined). The minimum response rates for the three components individually
were 37.8 percent for web-only, 39.7 percent for mixed web, and 27.6 percent for
mixed video.
The estimated overall response rates based on the observed rate of eligibility
(known as AAPOR Response Rate 3) on the pre-election interview were 42.1
percent for the web-only sample group, 44.2 percent for the mixed web group, 31.0
percent for the mixed video group, and 40.9 percent overall for the fresh cross-
sectional component. Table 2 below shows the AAPOR Response Rates 1 and 3
and the post-election re-interview rates for the fresh cross-sectional sample groups.

Notes. Response rates are based on AAPOR Response Rates 1 and 3. Re-interview rates are the
percentage of respondents from the pre-election that completed the post-election study. “Sufficient
partials” are included. Rates are not weighted.
The pre-election re-interview rate for the 2016-2020 panel cases was 77.9 percent.
Pre ‐ election interviews were considered sufficiently complete to be counted as
completions for weighting and for calculation of the response rate when the survey
was administered through item SELFGEND_GENDTYP. The estimated AAPOR
Response Rate 1 for the pre-election interview without the sufficient partial
interviews was 37.1 percent for web-only, 39.0 percent for mixed web, 27.3 percent
for mixed video, and 36.1 percent overall for the fresh cross-sectional component.
Post-election re-interviews were completed with 90.0 percent of pre-election
participants overall. These re-interview rates were 94.0 percent for the ANES 2016

Restricted Data Access
Some variables have been removed from the full release dataset in order to protect
respondent confidentiality. For these variables, the word “RESTRICTED” appears
at the beginning of the variable label and responses have been set to the value “-3.
Restricted.”
Examples of restricted variables include, but are not limited to: detailed geography,
detailed religious denomination, birth date, detailed education, detailed
business/industry, detailed occupation, detailed race/ethnicity, nationality, and
detailed income.
Users can apply for access to some restricted variables through a Restricted Data
Access agreement. Please see the Data Center on the ANES website for more
information about the application process and variable availability.
Non-confidential, redacted texts for open ‐ ended variables are available for
download as an auxiliary file from the ANES 2020 Time Series Study page on the
ANES website.
Data Analysis, Weights, and Variance Estimation
The data should be analyzed using weights to accurately represent the population.
Sampling errors should be calculated using methods that account for the complex
sample design and the effects of weighting on variance.
Weights
The full release of the dataset includes 14 post-stratified weight variables. These
weights replace the weights that were included in the preliminary releases of the
dataset. Compared to the preliminary weights on the previous datasets, the final
weights on the current dataset reduce the error in estimates of the presidential
election outcome and better facilitate design-consistent estimates of relatively small
population subgroups. Each weight variable is designed for analysis of a particular
subset or combination of sample cases.
For analysis of the complete set of cases using pre-election data only, including all
cases and representative of the 2020 electorate, use the full sample pre-election
weight, V200010a. For analysis including post-election data for the complete set of
participants (i.e., analysis of post-election data only or a combination of pre- and
post-election data), use the full sample post-election weight, V200010b. Additional
weights are provided for analysis of subsets of the data, as follows.
9
V200010a
Full sample pre-election weight. This weight is for the full pre-election
dataset, consisting of the combination of sample groups for the web-
only, mixed web, and mixed video modes, and the 2016-2020 panel
cases combined. Most analyses limited to pre-election data should
use this weight unless the sample group is intended to be limited to a
subset.
V200010b
Full sample post-election weight. This is the post-election version of
the full sample weight, V200010a, to be used if any post-election
data are included in the analysis of full-sample data.
V200011a
2016-2020 panel pre-election weight. This weight is for analysis of
the 2016-2020 panel cases (also labeled as sample type 2 in
V200003). Analyses should use this weight if the 2020 and 2016
data are merged and variables from the 2016 study are included in
the analysis, and the population of interest is the 2016 electorate,
and only pre-election data are used.
V200011b 2016-2020 panel post-election weight. This is the post-election
version of the 2016-2020 panel weight.
V200012a
Web-only sample pre-election weight. This weight is for analysis of
the web-only sample group alone (the sample subset limited to a
web questionnaire option, also known as sample group 3A).
V200012bWeb-only sample post-election weight.
V200013a
Mixed web sample pre-election weight. This weight is for analysis of
the mixed web sample group alone (the sample subset that used
sequential mixed-mode interviewing that included a telephone option
toward the end of the field period, also known as sample group 3B).
V200013bMixed web sample post-election weight.
V200014a
Mixed video sample pre-election weight. This weight is for analysis of
the mixed video sample group alone (the sample subset that used
sequential mixed-mode interviewing that attempted a video interview
but accepted a web questionnaire or telephone interview, also known
as sample group 3C).
V200014bMixed video sample post-election weight.
V200015a
All fresh sample pre-election weight. This weight is for analysis of
sample groups 3A, 3B, and 3C in combination, including all fresh
cross-sectional sample from 2020 but excluding the 2016 panel
cases.
V200015bAll fresh sample post-election weight.
10 USER GUIDE
V200016a
All sample excluding mixed video pre-election weight. This weight is
for analysis of the web-only, mixed web, and 2016-2020 panel cases
in combination (sample groups 2, 3A, and 3B), excluding the mixed
video sample group (3C).
V200016bAll sample excluding mixed video post-election weight.
Sampling errors and significance testing
Statistical procedures for complex sample designs should be used to obtain
appropriate estimates of sampling errors and indications of statistical significance.
Statistical software such as Stata, R with a survey analysis package, or SPSS with
the Complex Samples package can perform a Taylor Series calculation of sampling
errors when provided with the appropriate (pseudo-)strata and (pseudo-)cluster
(also known as PSU or variance unit) variables. In Stata, the command to set up
this type of analysis is as follows:
svyset [pweight=WEIGHT], strata(STRATA) psu(CLUSTER) 
In the code example above, WEIGHT would be replaced with the correct weight for
the type of analysis being performed (as indicated in the previous section on
weighting). STRATA and CLUSTER would be replaced with the corresponding
variance stratum and variance unit (PSU/cluster) for the selected weight, as
indicated below.
For weight use variance unit/PSU/clusterand use variance stratum

For example, the code to set up Stata for an analysis of the full sample including
post-election data is as follows:
svyset [pweight=V200010b], strata(V200010d) psu(V200010c) 
Note that the stratum and cluster variable names on this release are different than
the variable names on the first preliminary release of pre-election data, but the
names are identical to the second preliminary release of the pre- and post- election
dataset.

Weighting methodology
The weights for fresh sample cases were calculated in the following steps:
1. Base weights were calculated as the reciprocal of selection probability for
each address. Within each of the three sample groups (web-only, mixed
web, or mixed video) the selection probabilities were the same.
2. An adjustment was made for unknown address eligibility.
3. A screener nonresponse adjustment was made, weighting by the inverse of
base-weighted response rates within groups defined by Census region,
Census division, dwelling type, and whether or not the address had a
telephone number associated with it on the sampling frame.
4. An adjustment was made for within-household sampling based on the
selected person’s probability of selection within their household.
5. A pre-election nonresponse adjustment was made using two variables from
the screener: gender and the number of eligible adults in the household.
6. Pre-election raking adjustments were made to make survey estimates match
known population characteristics (for which the main source was the March
2020 Current Population Survey): age by gender, marital status by gender,
race/ethnicity by educational attainment, race/ethnicity by Census region,
nation of birth, home tenure by metropolitan status, population density,
household income, and early voter status. Large weight values were
trimmed.
12 USER GUIDE
7. Post-election raking adjustments were made using the same characteristics
as the pre-election adjustment.
8. Composite adjustments were made for combinations of sample groups.
These composites were raked using the dimensions listed above and also
adjust for different design effects in different sample groups by weighting
each sample group according to its effective (design-adjusted) sample size.
For re-interview cases from the ANES 2016 Time Series sample, weights were
calculated in the following steps:
1. Base weights consisted of the final 2016 post-election survey weight.
2. A sample-based raking adjustment for pre-election non-response was
applied to make the sample match the 2016 results for gender and for 2016
sample type (face-to-face or Internet).
3. Pre-election raking adjustments were made using the same factors
described above for the fresh sample cases, as well as sample-based
raking for the 2016 presidential candidate vote choice.
4. Post-election raking adjustments were made using the same characteristics
as the pre-election adjustments.
5. Composite adjustments were made, as described above for the fresh
sample cases.
Complete documentation of the weight calculation methods will be included in the
study’s forthcoming methodology report. Additional variables including replicate
weights and weights at calculation stages prior to final post-stratification will be
included in a future data release.
Orientation to the Data and Documentation
Dataset
The ANES 2020 Time Series Study Full Release is being made available in
multiple formats: SPSS (.sav), Stata (.dta), Comma Separated Values (.csv), and a
fixed-width raw data file that can be read into SAS, SPSS, and Stata using syntax
statements that have been provided.
Variables are stored using formats optimized for their data type. Missing data are
coded as negative numbers, for instance “-8. Don’t know”.
When downloading the dataset, users should also download and make use of the
two following pieces of documentation:
Questionnaire
The first piece of documentation is the Questionnaire, a document that provides
information about each of the questions that were asked in the survey. The
13
questions in the Questionnaire are presented in the order they were asked. The
Questionnaire includes the following information, where applicable, for each
question: the section in which the question appears, question name, question
wording, universe (where only a subset of respondents were to receive the
question, which respondents those should be), response options, question logic,
randomizations, display specifications, mode differences, and corresponding
variables from the ANES 2020 Time Series Study Full Release dataset.
User Guide and Codebook
The second piece of documentation is this User Guide and Codebook. The
remainder of this file, following this narrative section, consists of the codebook.
Whereas the Questionnaire provides information about questions that were asked
in the survey, the Codebook provides information about variables that appear in the
dataset.
Questions and variables do not always have a one-to-one relationship. For
instance, multiple questions may be combined into a single summary variable. Or
multiple variables may be derived from a single question. Furthermore, not all
variables have associated questions - for example, administrative variables.
The Codebook includes the following information, where applicable, for each
variable: the variable name (all variable names start with a “V”, and summary
variables end with the suffix “x”), variable label (with “PRE:” indicating that it is from
the pre-election study), question wording/variable meaning, response/code values
and meanings, universe (where only a subset of respondents appear in a variable,
which respondents those should be; note that universes are not included for most
summary variables), associated survey question(s), information about whether
randomization was used, interviewer instructions, and any other notes about the
variable.
At the end of the Codebook is an appendix that consists of the exact programming
code used to create some of the key summary variables in the dataset. Note that
the programming code is from a variety of statistical packages, including SAS and
SPSS, and that the programming code sometimes makes use of variables that may
not appear within the current dataset. The programming code is not intended to be
run “as is” on the current dataset, but rather to provide users insight into how the
summary variables were created.

Question
Four years ago, in 2016, Hillary Clinton ran on the Democratic
ticket against Donald Trump for the Republicans. We talk to
many people who tell us they did not vote. And we talk to a few
people who tell us they did vote, who really did not. We can tell
they did not vote by checking with official government records.
What about you? If we check the official government voter
records, will they show that you voted in the 2016 presidential
election, or that you did not vote in that election?

I’d like to get your feelings toward some of our political leaders and
other people who are in the news these days. I’ll read the name of a
person and I’d like you to rate that person using something we call
the feeling thermometer.  
Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel
favorable and warm toward the person. Ratings between 0 degrees
and 50 degrees mean that you don’t feel favorable toward the person
and that you don’t care too much for that person. You would rate the
person at the 50 degree mark if you don’t feel particularly warm or
cold toward the person.

INTRO POST-ELECTION POLITICAL FIGURE THERMOMETERS
I’d like to get your feelings toward some of our politicalleaders and
other people who are in the news these days.I’ll read the name of a
person and I’d like you to rate thatperson using something we call the
feeling thermometer.  
Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel
favorable and warm toward the person. Ratings between 0 degrees
and 50 degrees mean that you don’t feel favorable toward the person
and that you don’t care too much for that person. You would rate the
person at the 50 degree mark if you don’t feel particularly warm or
cold toward the person.  
If we come to a person whose name you don’t recognize, youdon’t
need to rate that person. Just tell me and we’ll move on to the next
one.

We’re going to describe a seven-point scale on which the
characteristics of the people in a group can be rated. In the first
POST-ELECTION SURVEY VARIABLES 601
statement a score of ‘1’ means that you think almost all of the people
in that group tend to be ‘hard-working.’ A score of ‘7’ means that you
think most people in the group are ‘lazy.’ A score of ‘4’ means that
you think that most people in the group are not closer to one end or
the other, and of course, you may choose any number in between.

INTRO HEALTH INSURANCE ISSUE
There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital
costs.  
Some people feel there should be a government insurance plan
which would cover all medical and hospital expenses for everyone.
Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.  
Others feel that all medical expenses should be paid by individuals
through private insurance plans like Blue Cross or other company
paid plans. Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.  
And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in
between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
