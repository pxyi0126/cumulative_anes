V020101     Pre-Election Post-stratified weight
=============================================================================

QUESTION:
---------
Pre-election Post-stratified weight

NOTES:
------
This is a 6-digit variable with a coded decimal point and
4 decimal places.
This weight compensates for the unequal probabilities of
selection for respondents in different size households and
for different non-response across geographic sample design
categories. 
A post-stratification adjustment used the 2000 CPS March
Supplement estimates as the standard. The cells were formed by 
crossing 6 age groups by 4 levels of education. The age groups 
were: 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+. The education 
levels were: < high school graduation, high school graduate, 
some college, and 4 years of college or more.

NOTES:
------
The Selection Table is used to select a respondent from all 
household members who are eligible adults.(An eligible adult is 
a U.S. citizen who is 18 years of age or older). A Selection 
Table was randomly assigned to all households in the Fresh 
Cross sample component.
After a complete listing of the HH was taken, each eligible
adult was assigned a "Number" based on the criteria of gender 
and age [beginning with the oldest male as number 1, males
numbered by increments of 1 according to descending age; 
females numbered by descending age starting with the number 
one higher than that assigned to the youngest male].  The 
interviewer then used the Selection Table to determine the 
"Number" of the eligible adult to be interviewed.  There were
8 different selection tables.

I"d like to get your feelings toward some people in the news 
these days. I"ll read the name of a person and I"ll ask you to
rate that person on a thermometer that runs from 0 to 100 
degrees. Rating above 50 means that you feel favorable and warm 
toward the person. Rating below 50 means that you feel
unfavorable and cool toward the person.  Rating right at the 50 
degree mark means you don"t feel particularly warm or cold.  
You may use any number from 0 to 100 to tell me how favorable 
or unfavorable your feelings are. If we come to a person whose 
name you don"t recognize, just tell me and we"ll move on to the 
next one.

I"d like to get your feelings toward some people in the news 
these days. I"ll read the name of a person and I"ll ask you to 
rate that person on a thermometer that runs from 0 to 100 
degrees. Rating above 50 means that you feel favorable and warm 
toward the person. Rating below 50 means that you feel 
unfavorable and cool toward the person.  Rating right at the 50 
degree mark means you don"t feel particularly warm or cold.
You may use any number from 0 to 100 to tell me how favorable
or unfavorable your feelings are. If we come to a person whose
name you don"t recognize, just tell me and we"ll move on to the
next one.
